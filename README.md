# Optimal-Routes-for-coal-mine-network-

**Description:**

The "Optimal Routes (for coal mine network)" project streamlines the coal transportation process within a mine network by leveraging Python and data analysis. This command-line tool is devoid of a graphical user interface, focusing on efficiency and automation. It utilizes Dijkstra's algorithm from data structures for route optimization based on real-time data, including sidings' distances and production values.

**Key Components and Technologies:**

1. **Python Data Analysis:**
   - Leverages Python for data manipulation and analysis.
   - Utilizes Pandas for efficient handling of tabular data.

2. **Dijkstra's Algorithm for Route Optimization:**
   - Implements Dijkstra's algorithm for determining the optimal routes between sidings.
   - Considers factors such as distance and dynamically changing production values.

3. **Real-time Data Handling:**
   - Incorporates real-time updates for siding distances and coal production values.
   - Ensures accurate and timely decision-making in coal transportation planning.

4. **Dynamic Production Updates:**
   - Allows users to dynamically update coal production values for each siding during runtime.
   - Provides adaptability to changing production scenarios without interrupting the optimization process.

5. **GitHub for Version Control:**
   - Utilizes Git and GitHub for version control, enabling collaborative development, code management, and transparency.

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository from GitHub.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
4. Run the Python script for coal transportation optimization.
5. Input siding names to trigger automatic retrieval of distances between sidings.
6. Dynamically update coal production values during runtime as needed.
7. Review the generated reports and analyses for optimal coal transportation routes.
